Refined 30-Day Strategy for Vet Industry
Audience advantage: Since you know they're all animal healthcare pros, you can:

Craft highly relevant subject lines and messaging
Reference industry pain points specifically
Use veterinary terminology that builds credibility
Time emails for their schedules (avoid surgery hours)

Segmented approach:

Week 1-2: Target practice owners/partners first (smaller segment, higher engagement)
Week 3-4: Expand to associate vets and practice managers
Launch: General veterinarians and specialists

Industry-specific timing:

Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 2-4 PM
Avoid Monday mornings (surgery scheduling) and Friday afternoons
Consider regional differences in practice hours

Recommended Messaging Framework
Subject lines that work for vets:

"Quick question about [specific challenge]"
"[Local area] veterinary practice efficiency"
"2-minute read: [relevant benefit]"

Engagement boosters:

Reference specific practice types (small animal, equine, etc.)
Mention local veterinary associations
Use case studies from similar practices

Since they're a professional audience, you'll likely see 15-25% open rates and 2-5% response rates, which is excellent for warming your domain reputation.
What's your offer/service for this audience? This will help refine the messaging strategy.RetryPa series of podcasts with supporting reports, aimed at users gaining cpd pointsEditExcellent - CPD (Continuing Professional Development) content for veterinarians is a strong value proposition that should drive good engagement. Vets are required to maintain CPD hours, so this addresses a real professional need.
CPD-Focused Strategy Advantages
High engagement potential:

CPD is mandatory for veterinary license maintenance
Free/accessible CPD content is always welcomed
Educational content has lower spam perception
Builds trust and authority quickly

Enhanced warming approach:

Lead with educational value, not sales
"Complimentary CPD opportunity" messaging
Reference specific CPD requirements by region (UK, Australia, etc.)

Messaging Framework for CPD Content
Subject line examples:

"Free CPD hours: [Topic] podcast series for veterinarians"
"[X] CPD points available - new veterinary podcast"
"Complimentary professional development: [specific topic]"

Email structure:

Acknowledge their CPD requirements
Brief description of podcast topics/experts
Mention CPD points/certificates available
Clear, simple registration process
Professional sign-off with credentials

Segmentation opportunities:

By practice type (small animal, large animal, exotic)
By career stage (new grad vs. experienced)
By specialty interests
By geographic region (different CPD requirements)

Platform Recommendations for Educational Content
Instantly or Smartlead still work well, but consider:

Mailchimp or ConvertKit for the educational/newsletter feel
Lemlist with their video features to preview podcast content

The educational angle significantly reduces spam risk and improves deliverability. Vets will actually appreciate receiving relevant CPD opportunities.
What topics are your podcasts covering? This affects which veterinary segments to prioritize.
