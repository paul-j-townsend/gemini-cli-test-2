Take out the "Take Quiz" button, and a "Get Certificate" button and replace them with a 'Listen to full version' button.

I'd like to change the functionality so that when a user first visits the podcast, the play button only plays an audio file. When the user clicks the 'Listen to full version' button, the second audio file must play

the "Take Quiz" and "Get Certificate" buttons will become available.
