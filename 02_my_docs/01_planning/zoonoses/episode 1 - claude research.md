# prompt to claude

i'm going to create a podcast series on the subject of zoonoses. They will be aimed at veterinarians. the series will comprise of seven episodes. This research will be used as the basis for episode 1: Foundations of zoonoses and the One Health Approach

The other 6 can be referenced near the end of the report. They are:

## Episode 2: High-Impact Zoonoses – Rabies, Leptospirosis, and Influenza

## Episode 3: Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonotic Threats

## Episode 4: Zoonoses in Food Production and Agrifood Systems

## Episode 5: Zoonoses in Companion and Exotic Animals

## Episode 6: Prevention, Control, and Communication

## Episode 7: The Future of Zoonoses – Surveillance, Technology, and Professional Development

Give the report a uk bias but make worldwide references when required

Give all sources with direct links and author names where available

## questions from claude

1. **What level of detail would you like for the foundations episode? Should I focus more on basic definitions and concepts, or include more advanced epidemiological and surveillance frameworks?**

   intermediate level detail. focus more on basic definitions and concepts

2. **For the UK bias, should I emphasize specific UK surveillance systems, legislation, and case studies, or would you prefer a broader European perspective with UK examples?**
