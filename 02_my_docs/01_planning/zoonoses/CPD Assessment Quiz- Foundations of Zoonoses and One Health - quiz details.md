CPD Assessment Quiz: Foundations of Zoonoses and One Health
Instructions
This quiz tests your understanding of the key concepts covered in the zoonoses and One Health learning objectives. Some questions may have more than one correct answer - select ALL that apply. Each question corresponds to specific learning objectives to help identify areas for further development.

Question 1: Zoonoses Classification and Risk Assessment
Learning Objective 1
According to the 2024 veterinary research framework published in Mammal Review, which classification approaches should be combined for comprehensive understanding of zoonotic disease patterns?
Select ALL that apply:
A) Pathogen type only (bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal)
B) Life cycle patterns (direct versus indirect transmission)
C) Transmission direction (animal-to-human, human-to-animal, or bidirectional)
D) Ecosystem context (wildlife, domestic animals, or mixed systems)
E) Geographical distribution patterns
Correct Answers: B, C, D
Explanation: The 2024 framework specifically combines four classification types: pathogen type, life cycle patterns, transmission direction, and ecosystem context. While pathogen type is mentioned as part of the framework, the question asks about the NEW approaches that should be combined with traditional methods. Geographical distribution is not part of this specific framework.

Question 2: UK Surveillance Systems and Legal Obligations
Learning Objective 2
Which organisms were added to the UK Zoonoses Order in 2021, and what is the correct reporting procedure for suspected rabies cases?
Select ALL that apply:
A) Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) was added to the designated organisms list
B) SARS-CoV-2 was added to the designated organisms list
C) Rabies must be reported to APHA immediately, even on clinical suspicion alone
D) Client consent is required before reporting suspected notifiable diseases
E) Veterinarians should contact the Defra Rural Services Helpline (03000 200 301) for suspected notifiable diseases in England
Correct Answers: A, B, C, E
Explanation: The Zoonoses (Amendment) (England) Order 2021 added both Coxiella burnetii and SARS-CoV-2. Rabies must be reported immediately on suspicion. Client consent is NOT required for statutory reporting. The Defra Rural Services Helpline is the correct contact for England.

Question 3: One Health Implementation Principles
Learning Objective 3
According to the One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) definition and the One Health Joint Plan of Action, which elements are essential for effective One Health implementation?
Select ALL that apply:
A) Integration - bringing together diverse disciplines and sectors
B) Sustainability - ensuring long-term viability of interventions
C) Optimization - maximizing health outcomes across human, animal, and environmental domains
D) Isolation - maintaining separate surveillance systems for each health sector
E) Coordination - aligning efforts and resources to avoid duplication and ensure coherent responses
Correct Answers: A, B, C, E
Explanation: The OHHLEP definition emphasizes integration, sustainability, and optimization. The OH JPA framework includes coordination as one of the four foundational pillars. Isolation contradicts One Health principles which emphasize integration and collaboration.

Question 4: Emerging Threats and Surveillance Data Interpretation
Learning Objective 4
Based on recent UK surveillance data presented in the report, which statements accurately reflect emerging zoonotic disease trends requiring veterinary attention?
Select ALL that apply:
A) West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time in 2023
B) Leptospirosis cases decreased from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024
C) Leptospirosis cases increased from 5 confirmed cases in Q1 2023 to 15 confirmed cases in Q1 2024
D) Usutu virus has been detected annually in UK wildlife since 2020
E) Campylobacteriosis accounts for approximately 59% of all confirmed zoonotic cases since 2005
Correct Answers: A, C, D, E
Explanation: West Nile virus was indeed first detected in UK mosquitoes in 2023. Leptospirosis cases INCREASED significantly (200% increase in confirmed cases). Usutu virus has been detected annually since 2020. Campylobacteriosis accounts for 58.9% of confirmed cases. Option B is incorrect as it states the opposite trend.

Question 5: Technology Integration and Professional Development
Learning Objective 5
Which advanced surveillance technologies and programs demonstrate the evolution of zoonoses monitoring capabilities that veterinary professionals should understand for contemporary practice?
Select ALL that apply:
A) PATH-SAFE Programme using DNA-sequencing technology for farm-to-fork pathogen tracking
B) SAVSNET covering 301 veterinary practices with real-time companion animal surveillance
C) Traditional paper-based reporting systems only
D) Genomic Data Platform enabling Salmonella tracking within days rather than weeks
E) Machine learning algorithms for text mining and outbreak detection in veterinary consultation records
Correct Answers: A, B, D, E
Explanation: PATH-SAFE represents cutting-edge genomic surveillance, SAVSNET provides innovative companion animal monitoring, the Genomic Data Platform enables rapid tracking, and machine learning enhances pattern detection. Traditional paper-based systems alone are insufficient for modern surveillance needs, though they may still play a supporting role.
