# Foundations of Zoonoses and One Health: Research Report for Veterinary Professionals

**Executive Summary**

The interconnected world of human, animal, and environmental health requires veterinary professionals to understand the complex landscape of zoonotic diseases and embrace collaborative approaches to disease prevention and control. This comprehensive research report provides the foundational knowledge necessary for Episode 1 of a veterinary-focused podcast series, examining the fundamental concepts of zoonoses, classification systems, transmission pathways, and the One Health approach within the UK context.

The emergence of COVID-19 dramatically highlighted the critical importance of zoonoses in global health security, with approximately 60% of known infectious diseases being zoonotic in origin and up to 75% of emerging infectious diseases having animal sources¹. This reality positions veterinary professionals at the forefront of public health protection, making comprehensive understanding of zoonotic disease fundamentals essential for contemporary practice.

The UK's robust surveillance systems, supported by extensive legislation and clear regulatory frameworks, provide a sophisticated model for zoonoses prevention and control. However, the post-Brexit landscape presents new challenges and opportunities that require adaptive approaches and enhanced international cooperation. Understanding these systems, combined with the principles of One Health, enables veterinary professionals to contribute meaningfully to disease prevention strategies while fulfilling their professional obligations.

This report synthesizes current evidence from leading international organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and UK agencies including the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), and Food Standards Agency (FSA). The analysis incorporates recent surveillance data, legislative updates, case studies, and emerging trends to provide veterinary professionals with practical, evidence-based guidance for zoonoses prevention and control in the contemporary UK environment.

## Understanding zoonoses through multiple classification frameworks

**Basic Definitions and Historical Context**

The World Health Organization defines zoonoses as "any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans," a definition maintained consistently across international health organizations including the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)¹. This straightforward definition encompasses a vast array of diseases that collectively cause an estimated **2.5 billion cases of human illness annually** and **2.7 million deaths worldwide** per year².

The term "zoonosis" originates from the Greek words "zoon" (animal) and "nosos" (disease), first coined by Rudolf Virchow in 1880. However, recognition of diseases transmissible between animals and humans dates back millennia, with ancient texts documenting rabies in dogs and humans as early as 2300 BCE. The scientific understanding of zoonoses evolved significantly during the 19th and 20th centuries, with landmark discoveries including Louis Pasteur's rabies vaccine (1885), the identification of plague transmission cycles (1894), and the recognition of yellow fever's mosquito vector (1900).

Modern veterinary medicine recognizes zoonoses as representing approximately **60% of all known infectious diseases** affecting humans, with **75% of emerging infectious diseases** being zoonotic in origin³. These statistics underscore the fundamental importance of veterinary expertise in public health protection and highlight the profession's central role in disease prevention strategies.

**Contemporary Statistical Burden and Global Impact**

The statistical burden reveals the magnitude of veterinary professionals' responsibility in global health security. Zoonoses represent the majority of infectious diseases affecting humans, with neglected zoonotic diseases alone accounting for at least **21 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** annually⁴. The economic impact is equally staggering, with the World Bank estimating that pandemic preparedness investments of $31 billion annually could prevent economic losses exceeding $2 trillion from future pandemic events.

In the European Union context, surveillance data demonstrates persistent zoonotic disease burdens despite advanced healthcare systems. **Campylobacteriosis accounts for 58.9% of all confirmed zoonotic cases** since 2005, followed by salmonellosis at 23.4%⁵. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports that **campylobacteriosis cases increased by 1.1% in 2023**, affecting 205,895 individuals across EU member states, with the highest rates observed in Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden.

UK-specific data reveals concerning trends requiring veterinary attention. The UK Health Security Agency reports **2,063 malaria cases in 2023**, the highest number in two decades, while **leptospirosis cases increased from 5 confirmed and 11 probable in Q1 2023 to 15 confirmed and 9 probable cases in Q1 2024**⁶. These trends reflect both enhanced surveillance capabilities and genuine epidemiological changes requiring professional vigilance.

**Advanced Classification Systems for Modern Practice**

Contemporary veterinary science employs multiple classification frameworks that help practitioners understand disease patterns and transmission risks more comprehensively than traditional pathogen-based systems. The conventional approach divides zoonoses into bacterial (anthrax, salmonellosis, tuberculosis), viral (rabies, avian influenza, COVID-19), parasitic (toxoplasmosis, echinococcosis), fungal (ringworm), rickettsial (Q-fever), and prion diseases (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).

However, a **2024 veterinary research framework published in Mammal Review** proposes a more sophisticated approach combining four classification types: pathogen type, life cycle patterns (direct versus indirect transmission), transmission direction (animal-to-human, human-to-animal, or bidirectional), and ecosystem context (wildlife, domestic animals, or mixed systems)⁷. This framework better reflects the complexity of modern zoonotic disease emergence and provides practical guidance for surveillance and control strategies.

Epidemiological patterns further categorize zoonoses as endemic (consistently present, such as brucellosis in certain regions), epidemic (sporadic outbreaks with varying intensity), or emerging and re-emerging (newly appearing or rapidly increasing, exemplified by SARS, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19). The **Council on Foreign Relations** identifies climate change, urbanization, agricultural intensification, and increased human-wildlife contact as primary drivers of emerging zoonotic disease patterns⁸.

**Transmission Pathways and Epidemiological Principles**

Understanding transmission mechanisms is crucial for effective prevention strategies and risk assessment. Research published in the **National Center for Biotechnology Information** reveals distinct transmission patterns by pathogen type, with significant implications for veterinary practice and public health interventions⁹.

**Vector-borne transmission dominates viral zoonoses**, with arthropod vectors like ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas serving as primary routes for diseases including West Nile virus, Lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis. Recent UK surveillance detected **West Nile virus in mosquitoes for the first time in 2023**, highlighting the expanding geographical range of vector-borne diseases due to climate change and increased international travel¹⁰.

Foodborne transmission represents the most common pathway for bacterial zoonoses, accounting for the majority of salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and STEC infections. The **European Union One Health 2023 Zoonoses Report** documents 4,869 foodborne outbreaks affecting 38,675 people, with **Salmonella responsible for 24.8% of outbreaks** despite declining overall trends⁵. This pathway requires particular attention from veterinary professionals involved in food production systems and HACCP implementation.

Direct contact transmission occurs through physical contact with infected animals or contaminated body fluids, representing a significant occupational hazard for veterinary professionals. The UK's **Common Animal-Associated Infections surveillance** reports persistent cases of psittacosis, Q fever, and orf among veterinary personnel, emphasizing the importance of appropriate personal protective equipment and biosafety protocols¹¹.

Environmental transmission through contaminated water, soil, or surfaces affects pathogens that persist in the environment for extended periods. This pathway is particularly relevant for **anthrax spores** (which can survive for decades), **Leptospira** (surviving in alkaline water for months), and **Toxoplasma gondii oocysts** (remaining viable in soil for years). Understanding environmental persistence patterns enables veterinary professionals to assess long-term contamination risks and implement appropriate decontamination strategies.

**Reservoir Dynamics and Maintenance Hosts**

The concept of reservoir hosts is fundamental to understanding zoonotic disease ecology and developing effective control strategies. Maintenance hosts are species in which pathogens can perpetuate indefinitely without external input, while spillover hosts represent incidental infections that typically result in dead-end transmission chains.

Wildlife reservoirs present particular challenges for disease control, as they often remain asymptomatic while maintaining high pathogen loads. **Bats serve as reservoir hosts for over 200 viruses**, including rabies, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and potentially SARS-CoV-2¹². The UK's enhanced bat surveillance programs, coordinated through APHA, monitor these populations for emerging viral threats while balancing conservation objectives.

Domestic animal reservoirs require different management approaches, as they are accessible to veterinary intervention through vaccination, treatment, and husbandry modifications. **Cattle serve as maintenance hosts for bovine tuberculosis**, while **pigs can harbor both pandemic influenza viruses and Nipah virus**. Understanding these reservoir dynamics enables veterinary professionals to implement targeted interventions that reduce zoonotic disease risks.

## UK surveillance systems and regulatory framework

**Comprehensive Multi-Agency Surveillance Architecture**

The United Kingdom has established one of the world's most sophisticated zoonoses surveillance systems, characterized by multi-agency coordination, comprehensive data integration, and rapid response capabilities. The architecture reflects decades of development following major disease outbreaks, including the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic and the 2003 SARS pandemic, which highlighted the need for enhanced surveillance and preparedness systems.

The **Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) Group**, established in 2004, serves as the cornerstone of UK zoonoses surveillance¹³. This multi-agency horizon scanning and risk assessment body meets weekly to review global and domestic disease intelligence, bringing together representatives from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Food Standards Agency (FSA), Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales, and Northern Ireland departments.

HAIRS operates through a structured risk assessment process that combines global disease intelligence, domestic surveillance data, and expert analysis to identify emerging threats. The group maintains a **risk register of over 200 zoonotic pathogens**, regularly updated based on changing epidemiological patterns, climate projections, and trade considerations. This systematic approach enables early warning systems and coordinated response planning across sectors.

**Animal Health Surveillance Infrastructure**

The **Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)** operates the primary animal surveillance network through **15 Veterinary Investigation Centres (VICs)** across England and Wales, supported by **regional laboratories and specialist units**¹⁴. This network delivers both statutory surveillance for notifiable diseases and scanning surveillance for early detection of emerging threats, processing over **50,000 diagnostic submissions annually**.

The **Surveillance Intelligence Unit (SIU)** manages surveillance activities through **Species Expert Groups (SEGs)** covering cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, companion animals, wildlife, and equines. These groups analyze surveillance data, identify disease trends, and provide expert interpretation of epidemiological patterns. The **Surveillance Epidemiology and Data Analysis (SEDA)** team supports these activities through statistical analysis, modeling, and data visualization¹⁵.

APHA's **scanning surveillance program** represents a unique approach to early threat detection, combining passive surveillance (diagnostic submissions from veterinary practitioners) with active surveillance (targeted sampling programs). The **Great Britain Wildlife Disease Surveillance Partnership** extends this coverage to wildlife populations, coordinating with the Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology, and university partners to monitor disease patterns in wild animal populations.

**Human Health Surveillance Coordination**

The **UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)** manages surveillance of non-foodborne zoonoses for England, with parallel arrangements in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The agency operates **24/7 surveillance systems** monitoring laboratory reports, clinical notifications, and international disease intelligence through the **Global Health Security Programme**.

The **Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (EIZ) team** provides specialized risk assessment capabilities, maintaining expertise in vector-borne diseases, wildlife zoonoses, and emerging viral threats. The **Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology (MEZE) team** specifically focuses on vector-borne disease risks, conducting enhanced surveillance for invasive mosquito species and tick-borne pathogens.

UKHSA's **Field Epidemiology Service** provides rapid response capabilities for zoonotic disease outbreaks, with **regional teams** trained in outbreak investigation, contact tracing, and environmental assessment. These teams coordinate closely with APHA and local authorities to ensure comprehensive investigation of human-animal interface incidents.

**Food Safety and Zoonoses Integration**

The agency's **Incidents and Resilience Unit** maintains **24/7 response capabilities**, coordinating with APHA for farm-to-fork investigations and with UKHSA for human health impact assessment.

The **National Food Crime Unit (NFCU)** addresses intentional adulteration and fraud within food systems, including deliberate contamination with zoonotic pathogens. This specialized unit coordinates with law enforcement agencies and international partners to investigate food-related crimes that may pose zoonotic disease risks.

FSA's **enhanced surveillance programs** include the **Salmonella National Control Programme**, **Campylobacter baseline surveys**, and **antimicrobial resistance monitoring** across food production systems. These programs generate comprehensive data on zoonotic pathogen prevalence, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and risk factors for human exposure.

**Legislative Framework and Professional Obligations**

The UK's zoonoses legislation builds upon the foundation of the **Animal Health Act 1981**, which provides comprehensive powers for disease control including quarantine, movement restrictions, slaughter orders, and compensation arrangements¹⁷. This act established the legal framework for veterinary involvement in disease control, including powers of entry, sampling, and testing.

The **Zoonoses Order 1989** designated specific organisms that constitute risks to human health when carried in animals, originally covering **Salmonella** species and **Brucella** species¹⁸. This order established reporting requirements for veterinary surgeons, laboratory operators, and animal owners, creating legal obligations for disease notification and investigation.

Recent legislative updates demonstrate the system's adaptability to emerging threats. The **Zoonoses (Amendment) (England) Order 2021** added **Coxiella burnetii** (Q fever) and **SARS-CoV-2** to the list of designated organisms, reflecting lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. The amendment extended reporting requirements to include dogs for salmonella and brucella organisms and prescribed specific sampling and testing protocols for the new organisms.

The **Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010** establish parallel requirements for human health professionals, creating a comprehensive notification system covering both animal and human cases of zoonotic diseases. These regulations enable coordinated investigation of animal-human interface incidents and facilitate early detection of emerging threats.

**Professional Responsibilities and Ethical Considerations**

Veterinary professionals face clear legal and ethical obligations under these frameworks. The **Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) Code of Professional Conduct** specifies that veterinarians must report suspected cases of certain infectious diseases immediately, even based on clinical suspicion alone. **Rabies must be reported to APHA immediately**¹⁹, and client consent is not necessary for statutory reporting requirements.

The **Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013** include specific provisions for reporting adverse events that may indicate zoonotic disease risks, including unexpected treatment failures that might suggest antimicrobial resistance development. These regulations establish pharmacovigilance obligations that contribute to broader zoonoses surveillance systems.

**Professional indemnity considerations** require veterinarians to understand their legal obligations and ensure compliance with reporting requirements. Failure to report notifiable diseases can result in prosecution under the Animal Health Act 1981, with potential penalties including fines and professional sanctions.

**Reporting Procedures and System Integration**

The reporting system operates through established channels designed to ensure rapid notification and coordinated response. Veterinarians must contact the **Defra Rural Services Helpline (03000 200 301)** for suspected notifiable diseases in England, **APHA Wales (0300 303 8268)** for Welsh cases, and **local APHA Scotland offices** for Scottish notifications²⁰.

The **electronic reporting systems** enable real-time data sharing between agencies, with automated alerts triggering coordinated investigations. The **Animal Disease Information System (ADIS)** provides secure data sharing capabilities across government departments, while the **Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)** enables rapid sharing of diagnostic results.

**Emergency response protocols** ensure 24/7 availability of expert advice and rapid deployment of investigation teams. The **National Emergency Epidemiology Group (NEEG)** provides strategic coordination during major incidents, while **regional response teams** deliver operational capabilities for outbreak investigation and control.

**International Coordination and Post-Brexit Adaptations**

The post-Brexit landscape has required significant adaptations to surveillance and reporting systems. The UK has negotiated **bilateral agreements** with EU member states for continued disease intelligence sharing, while developing enhanced relationships with **WOAH**, **WHO**, and **FAO** for global disease surveillance.

The **UK Zoonoses, Animal Diseases and Infections Group (UKZADI)** serves as an independent expert committee advising the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Veterinary Officer on disease trends and emerging threats. This quarterly-meeting group provides strategic coordination between agricultural and public health departments, focusing on zoonotic infections and antimicrobial resistance patterns.

**Trade implications** of disease notifications require careful balance between public health protection and economic considerations. The **Export Health Certification** system ensures international trade requirements are met while maintaining robust domestic surveillance, with veterinary professionals playing crucial roles in certification processes.

## One Health approach implementation and success stories

**Foundational Principles and Theoretical Framework**

The One Health concept represents a fundamental paradigm shift in approaching health challenges, recognizing the interconnected nature of human, animal, and environmental health systems. The **One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP)**, established by the Quadripartite organizations (FAO, WHO, WOAH, and UNEP), provides the current operational definition: "One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems"²¹.

This definition, developed through extensive consultation and scientific review, emphasizes three critical elements: **integration** (bringing together diverse disciplines and sectors), **sustainability** (ensuring long-term viability of interventions), and **optimization** (maximizing health outcomes across all domains). The approach acknowledges that human health outcomes cannot be achieved in isolation from animal and environmental health considerations.

The **philosophical foundation** of One Health rests on recognition that approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, climate change is altering disease distribution patterns, antimicrobial resistance threatens medical advances across species, and food security depends on healthy ecosystems and productive agriculture²². These interconnections necessitate collaborative approaches that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries.

**Core Implementation Principles and Operational Framework**

The One Health approach builds upon four foundational pillars that guide implementation from community to global levels. **Communication** facilitates inter-sectoral dialogue, ensuring that human health professionals, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and policy makers can share information effectively. This pillar addresses the historical silos between disciplines and creates platforms for meaningful collaboration.

**Collaboration** emphasizes working across disciplines, sectors, and geographical boundaries to address health challenges comprehensively. This pillar recognizes that no single profession or organization possesses all the expertise necessary to address complex health threats, requiring partnership approaches that leverage diverse capabilities and perspectives.

**Coordination** focuses on aligning efforts and resources to avoid duplication, maximize efficiency, and ensure coherent responses to health challenges. This pillar addresses the practical challenges of implementing multi-sectoral approaches, including funding mechanisms, governance structures, and accountability frameworks.

**Capacity building** develops skills, infrastructure, and institutional capabilities necessary for effective One Health implementation. This pillar recognizes that successful collaboration requires investment in training, technology, and systems that enable effective cross-sectoral working.

**Global Implementation Framework and Strategic Direction**

The **One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH JPA) 2022-2026** provides a structured implementation framework through three complementary pathways²³. **Pathway 1** focuses on governance, policy, legislation, financing, and advocacy, emphasizing the need for political commitment and dedicated resources. This pathway recognizes that successful One Health implementation requires supportive policy environments and sustainable funding mechanisms.

**Pathway 2** addresses organizational development, implementation, and sectoral integration, highlighting workforce development and community engagement requirements. This pathway emphasizes the importance of building institutional capabilities and fostering collaborative cultures within organizations.

**Pathway 3** concentrates on data, evidence, information systems, and knowledge exchange, recognizing the importance of scientific evidence and robust surveillance systems.

## Professional development and future directions

**Evolving Veterinary Roles in Global Health Security**

Veterinary professionals occupy a uniquely positioned role in the One Health ecosystem due to their **comprehensive health perspective** encompassing animal, human, and environmental health connections. This positioning becomes increasingly critical as globalization, climate change, and agricultural intensification create new pathways for zoonotic disease emergence and transmission.

Recent surveys indicate that **82% of US veterinarians** are familiar with One Health concepts, though **only 51.3% knew of continuing education opportunities** on zoonoses-specific topics³¹. This knowledge gap highlights the urgent need for enhanced professional development programs that bridge theoretical understanding with practical implementation skills. The **Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association** emphasizes that effective zoonoses management requires veterinarians to develop competencies beyond traditional clinical skills.

The **American Veterinary Medical Association** identifies four key areas where veterinarians contribute to One Health implementation: **clinical and preventive medicine** (recognizing and treating zoonotic diseases), **public health and safety** (participating in surveillance and outbreak investigation), **surveillance and monitoring** (contributing to early detection systems), and **research and innovation** (advancing understanding of disease ecology and transmission)³².

**Core Competency Development for Modern Practice**
