i'd like to rethink the formatting/functionality of the podcasts page:

# Latest Episodes page

make it more compact.

move the quiz button from here into the main podcast page.

I want to display multiple series on the page, with multiple episodes within the series. i still want each episode to have a short audo preview and clicking through to the main podcast page.

the main podcast page looks good but the button functionality needs rethinking...there should always be a quiz button. add a new 'download report' button which is also always available which will allow the user to download a pdf.

remove 'Open in Full Player'
