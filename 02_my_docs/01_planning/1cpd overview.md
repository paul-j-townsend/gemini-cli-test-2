1CPD is the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) online platform for managing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for veterinary professionals in the UK. It’s designed to help vets and veterinary nurses plan, record, and reflect on their learning and development in a structured and user-friendly way.

🔍 What is 1CPD?
1CPD is a web-based and mobile app platform created by the RCVS to meet the evolving needs of CPD recording. It replaced the older Professional Development Record (PDR) system and aligns with the RCVS CPD Policy, which focuses not just on hours, but also on the quality and impact of learning.

📱 Key Features of 1CPD

📊 CPD Requirements in the UK
As per RCVS policy:

Veterinary Surgeons: Minimum of 35 hours/year

Registered Veterinary Nurses: Minimum of 15 hours/year

Reflective learning is strongly encouraged

CPD can be self-directed, including activities like:

Listening to veterinary podcasts (like yours)

Reading journals or clinical guidelines

Participating in case discussions

Attending courses or conferences

🧠 Why Reflection Matters
1CPD emphasises reflective practice—thinking about:

What you learned

How it applies to your work

What you might do differently
This is part of the move towards outcomes-based CPD rather than just ticking boxes.

❗ Pros and Cons
✅ Pros
Encourages meaningful learning

Easy to access and use on the go

Supports a wide range of CPD types

Aligned with current RCVS expectations

❌ Cons
Some users find the reflection prompts repetitive

Doesn’t auto-sync with external providers (yet)

Can feel admin-heavy if not used regularly

📝 Summary
1CPD is more than a logbook—it’s a tool to support lifelong learning in a way that’s flexible, reflective, and compliant with RCVS standards. It’s ideal for professionals who want to show not just what they’ve done, but how it’s made a difference.
